## 🚀 What It Does

Most job seekers apply to hundreds of postings blindly. This tool uses **semantic search** and **LLM reasoning** to actually understand how well your background matches each job — then explains *why* and writes you a tailored cover letter.

| Feature | How It Works |
|---|---|
| **Resume Parsing** | Extracts text from PDF/TXT, then uses Claude to identify skills, experience, education, and target roles |
| **Job Search** | Live search via JSearch API (500+ free requests/month) or upload your own CSV of job postings |
| **RAG Matching** | Embeds resume + jobs using Sentence-BERT → stores in ChromaDB → retrieves top semantic matches → Claude scores and analyzes each one |
| **Skill Gap Analysis** | For each job: which of your skills match, which are missing, and a plain-English explanation of your fit |
| **Cover Letter Gen** | One-click tailored cover letters that reference your specific skills and the job's requirements |

## 🏗️ Architecture

**System Overview:**

| Component | Role | Technology |
|---|---|---|
| **Streamlit UI** | Resume upload, job search, results display, cover letter view | Streamlit |
| **Resume Parser** | Extracts raw text from PDF/TXT files | pypdf |
| **Profile Extractor** | Pulls structured skills, experience, education from resume text | Claude API |
| **Job Fetcher** | Searches live jobs or parses uploaded CSV | JSearch API / CSV |
| **RAG Match Engine** | Embeds resume + jobs, retrieves similar jobs, scores matches | Sentence-BERT + ChromaDB + Claude |
| **Cover Letter Generator** | Writes tailored cover letters per job match | Claude API |

**RAG Pipeline Flow:**

> **Resume Text** → Sentence-BERT → **384-dim embedding** → cosine similarity query against ChromaDB
>
> **Job Descriptions** → Sentence-BERT → **ChromaDB Vector Store** → top-k retrieval
>
> **Top Matches + Resume** → Claude Sonnet 4 → **Match Score + Skill Gaps + Reasoning**

**Why RAG instead of just sending everything to an LLM?**

- **Cost**: Embedding 50 jobs costs ~$0.00. Sending all 50 full job descriptions to Claude would cost ~$0.50+ per query.
- **Speed**: Vector similarity search returns in milliseconds. Analyzing all jobs with Claude would take minutes.
- **Accuracy**: Semantic embeddings catch matches that keyword search misses ("ML" ↔ "machine learning", "dashboards" ↔ "data visualization"). Claude then adds the nuanced reasoning layer only for relevant matches.

## 📦 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Streamlit | Fast prototyping, interactive widgets, easy deployment |
| **LLM** | Anthropic Claude (Sonnet 4) | Best reasoning for match analysis and writing |
| **Embeddings** | Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) | Fast, free, runs locally — no API costs for embeddings |
| **Vector DB** | ChromaDB | Lightweight, in-memory, zero config — ideal for this scale |
| **PDF Parsing** | pypdf | Pure Python, no system dependencies |
| **Job Data** | JSearch API + CSV | Real jobs from API, or bring your own data |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automated linting, testing, Docker build on every push |
| **Container** | Docker | Reproducible deployment anywhere |

## 🎯 How Matching Works — In Detail

**Step 1: Resume Understanding**
Your resume PDF is parsed into raw text, then sent to Claude with a structured extraction prompt. Claude returns a JSON profile: skills, experience years, education, target job titles, and key achievements.

**Step 2: Semantic Embedding**
Both your resume and all job descriptions are converted to 384-dimensional vectors using Sentence-BERT. This captures *meaning*, not just keywords — so "built ML pipelines" matches "machine learning engineering" even though the words are different.

**Step 3: Vector Retrieval**
Job embeddings are stored in ChromaDB. Your resume embedding is used as a query — ChromaDB returns the most semantically similar jobs ranked by cosine similarity. This is the "Retrieval" in RAG.

**Step 4: LLM Analysis**
The top matches (resume + job descriptions) are sent to Claude for detailed analysis. Claude returns:
- **Match score** (0-100) with calibrated guidelines
- **Matching skills** — what you have that they want
- **Skill gaps** — what's missing and how critical it is
- **Reasoning** — plain-English explanation of fit

**Step 5: Cover Letter Generation**
For any match, one click generates a tailored cover letter that references your specific skills, addresses skill gaps honestly, and uses details from the job posting.

## 🛠️ Extending This Project

Some ideas if you want to fork and build on this:

- **Add more job sources**: Indeed, LinkedIn (with scraping), or Greenhouse API
- **Job alerts**: Schedule daily searches and email new high-match jobs
- **Interview prep**: Generate likely interview questions based on skill gaps
- **Multi-resume support**: Compare how different resume versions score against the same jobs
- **Analytics dashboard**: Track application history, response rates, score distributions
